============

Car Plant Kata; javascript version of https://github.com/kevinrutherford/car-plant

Clone the repo, and load 'specrunner.html' into a web browser to run the test suite. Consider ways of fixing the failing tests.

The kata uses a 'LOG' string in the CarPlant class to record (and test for) side effects.
